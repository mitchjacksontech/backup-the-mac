# Backup The Mac

Create a backup of a MacOS user's data.

I've fixed thousands of Macs.  This script automates the backup and restore
of the user's data for my coworkers who aren't proficient with bash and
rsync.  Non-techies can double-click the .command file within finder to
start a backup job. When possible, the script will prevent system sleep
from pausing backup process.
